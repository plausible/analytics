  Translates an event:goal filter into SQL. Similarly to other `add_filter` clauses in
  `Plausible.Stats.SQL.WhereBuilder`, returns an `Ecto.Query.dynamic` expression.

  Compared to other dimensions, filtering by goals works differently. First, we expect
  all goals to be preloaded into the query - this list of goals is what actually gets
  filtered by `operator` and `clauses`.

  With the resulting filtered list of goals, we build conditions for whether that goal
  was completed or not, and join those conditions with a logical OR.

  ### Options

  * `imported?` - when `true`, builds conditions on the `page` db field rather than
    `pathname`, and also skips the `e.name == "pageview"` check.
