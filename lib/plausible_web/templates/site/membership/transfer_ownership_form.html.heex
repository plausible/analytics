    Transfer ownership of {@site.domain}
  </:title>
  <:subtitle>
    Enter the email address of the new owner. We will contact them over email to
    offer them the ownership of {@site.domain}. If they don't respond in 48
    hours, the request will expire automatically. <br /><br />
    Do note that a subscription plan is not transferred alongside the site. If
    they accept the transfer request, the new owner will need to have an active
    subscription. Your access will be downgraded to <b>admin</b>
    and any other
    member roles will stay the same.
