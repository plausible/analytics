Time flies! This is a reminder that your annual subscription for {Plausible.product_name()} will expire on {@next_bill_date}.
<br /><br /> You need to
<a href={PlausibleWeb.Router.Helpers.billing_url(PlausibleWeb.Endpoint, :choose_plan)}>renew your subscription</a> if you want to continue using Plausible to count your website stats in a privacy-friendly way.
<br /><br />
If you don't want to continue your subscription, there's no action required. You will lose access to your dashboard on {@next_bill_date} and we'll stop accepting stats on {@accept_traffic_until}.
