       Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!

       Please note that this tracker is only for bugs. Do not use the issue tracker for help, customer support or feature requests.

       [Our docs](https://plausible.io/docs) are a great place for most answers, but if you can’t find your answer there, you can [contact our customer support](https://plausible.io/contact).

       Have a feature request? Please search the ideas [on our forum](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/discussions/categories/feature-requests) to make sure that the feature has not yet been requested. If you cannot find what you had in mind, please [submit your feature request here](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/discussions/new).

       Have an issue with your self-hosted install? Self-hosted is community supported and you can ask in [our self-hosted forum](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/discussions/categories/self-hosted-support).

       Note also that self-hosted is a long term release published twice per year so latest features won’t be immediately available as they’re battled-tested in the cloud first. Take a look [at this list for features available in the self-hosted](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/releases).

       **Thanks!**
